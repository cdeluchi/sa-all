// Write a constructor called Countdown that accepts a single argument -
// the number of seconds to count down.
// It should be possible to call the start method of instances of Countdown to initiate the countdown.
// Once the countdown starts, it should count down to zero starting with the number that was passed to the constructor
// and logging each number to the console with a one second delay.

var s = 10;
setTimeout(function Countdown(s) {
    for (var i = 0; i > 10; i--) console.log(i);
